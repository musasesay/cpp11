* an *enumeration* is a type that can hold a set of integer values specified by
  the user

* *enumerator*s are some of the possible listed `enum` names

* plain `enum` has the same scope for names as the `enum` and its enumerators
  implicitly convert to other types

* `enum class` have enumerators local to it and their values do not implicitly
  convert to other types

* every enumeration is represented by some integral type and every enumerator
  has associated value

* the integral type representing enumeration is called *underlying type* and can
  be explicitly specified, e.g.:

```c++
enum class EWarning : char {
    W_Red = 1,
    W_Yellow = 2,
    W_Green = 3
};
enum EType : long long {
    T_Integer,
    T_Float
};
```

* if you don't specify the underlying type, you can't forward the enum
  declaration

* by default values start form `0`

* enumerators can be initialized by a `constexpr` of integral type

* an `enum` is a user-defined type and can have user-defined operators

* an integral value can be explicitly cast to `enum class` but the result is
  undefined if underlying type can not hold the value, e.g.:

```c++
EWarning a {};  // will have a default value of 0
EWarning b {static_cast<EWarning>(5)};  // possible but no enumerator
EWarning c {static_cast<EWarning>(1024)};  // undefined
```

* `sizeof` an `enum class` is equal to size of underlying type

* the enumerators of a plain `enum` are exported into the `enum`'s scope and
  implicitly converted to  values of some integral type

* the injection of names into an enclosing scope is called a
  *namespace polllution*

* underlying type is determined by the following logic:
    - positive enumerators, k-bits, so that all values lie in `[0, 2^k - 1]` 
    - positive and negative, [-2^k, 2^k - 1]

* plain `enum` implicitly converts enumerators to integral types but one always
  needs to convert integral type to any enumeration

* plain `enum` can be unnamed, e.g.:

```c++
enum {
    up, down
};
```

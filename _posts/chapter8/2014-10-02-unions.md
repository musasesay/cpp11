* a `union` is a `struct` in which all members are allocated at the same address
  so that the `union` occupies only as much space as its largest member

* the language does not keep track of which kind of value is help by a `union`

* restrictions imposed on `union`s:
    - no virtual functions
    - no references
    - no base classes
    - can not be used as a base class
    - user-defined constructor, copy or move of any member will be deleted
    - at most one member can have an in-class initializer

```
union TData {
    int a;
    const char* b {"empty"};
};
```

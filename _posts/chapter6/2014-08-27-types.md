* C++ ISO standard: `ISO/IEC 14882:2011`

* *implementation-defined* means that each implementation must provide a
  specific, well-defined behavior for a construct and that behavior must be
  documented

* *unspecified* is a behavior with several possible outcomes and the
  implementation is not obliged to specify which actually occur, e.g. race
  condition

* fundamental types:
    - boolean: `bool` 
    - character: `char`, `wchar_t`
    - integer: `int`
    - floating-point: `float`, `double`
    - absence of information: `void`

* declarator operators:
    - pointer: `int*`
    - array: `int []`
    - reference: `int&`, `int&&`

* user-defined types:
    - data structures and classes: `struct`, `class`
    - enumerations (specific set of values): `enum`, `enum class`

* *integral* types: boolean, character and integer

* *arithmetic* types: integral and floating-point

* *built-in* types: fundamental, pointers and references

* a *predicate* is a function that tests some condition

* in arithmetic and logical expressions, `bool`s are converted to `int`s

* the `_t` suffix often denotes aliases

* arithmetic and bitwise logical operations apply to all integral types

* character type comes in three forms: `char`, `signed char`, and
  `unsigned char` that behave identically but these are distinct types:
  pointers do not mix

* it is implementation-defined wether `char` is signed or unsigned

* like `char`, integer comes in three forms: `int`, `signed int` and
  `unsigned int`, and four sizes: `short int`, `int`, `long int`,
  `long long int`

* `int` is *always* signed

* integer literal has a form: `[prefix]value[suffix]` where *prefix* is one of
  the following: `0` (octal), or `x` (hexadecimal) and suffix is: `L` (long) or
  `U` unsigned

* there are three forms of floating-point types: `float`, `double`, and
  `long double`

* by definition `sizeof(char) == 1` and size of other types are measured in
  `sizeof(char)`

* values are converted between fundamental types so as not to lose information

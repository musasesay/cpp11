### Introduction

Reader of any technical book has to:

* take notes
* solve problems

The first item helps to emphasize new ideas and memorize them.  Problems solving
is a must have skill: theory is nothing without practice and vice versa.  IT is
not an exception.  Bjarne Stroustrup said in his book (ch 1.5 - Advice):

> In general: To write a good program takes intelligence, taste, and patience. 
> You are not going to get it right the first time. Experiment! -- Bjarne
> Stroustrup


### About

This is a collection of notes, exercises and thoughts on "The C++ Programming
Language" 4th edition by Bjarne Stroustrup.  I remember reading the 3rd edition
back in 2004.  It was one of the best books I ever had to go through.
Unfortunately, I lost notes and exercises code since then.  This time everything
is documented and open for use.

The project consists of two sections:

* [Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/)
* [Exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/)

Notes and exercise are split into chapters.

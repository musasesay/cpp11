The idea is to unwind the loop and reduce number of times the condition is
tested in the loop.

The denominator `8` may be any integral value that is not equal to zero. However
the number of `case`s should be `N - 1` and `7` must be replaced by `N - 1`.

The code is very confusing and should be avoided.
